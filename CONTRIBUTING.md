# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing to go-appsec/interactsh-lite!

## Getting Started

**Setup:**
```bash
# Fork the repository, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/interactsh-lite
cd interactsh-lite

# Install dependencies for both modules
go mod download
cd interactsh-srv && go mod download && cd ..

# Verify your setup
make test-all
```

## Project Structure

This is a multi-module Go repository:

- **Root module** (`github.com/go-appsec/interactsh-lite`): Client library (`oobclient/`) and client CLI.
- **Server module** (`github.com/go-appsec/interactsh-lite/interactsh-srv`): Server library (`oobsrv/`) and server CLI.

Changes to shared types (e.g., `oobclient.Interaction`) require a client module release before the server module can adopt them.

## Development Workflow

**Available Commands:**
```bash
make build       # Build both binaries into bin/
make test        # Run fast tests
make test-all    # Run all tests with race detection and coverage
make test-cover  # Generate HTML coverage report
make lint        # Run linting and static analysis
make bench       # Run benchmarks
```

## Pull Requests

1. Create a feature branch on your personal fork
2. Make your changes following existing code patterns. Ensure testing is also added to cover the feature or bug behavior.
3. Run `make test-all && make lint` to verify everything passes
4. Commit with clear, descriptive messages
5. Push to your fork and open a pull request
